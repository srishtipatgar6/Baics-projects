🖼️ How It Works

Upload an Image: Users can select and upload a photo from their device.

Choose a Style: After uploading, users can choose from various poetic styles or themes.

Generate Poem: The application then processes the image and style to generate a unique poem inspired by the photo.

The resulting poem is a creative blend of visual and textual art, offering a novel way to express emotions and stories through both imagery and poetry.
